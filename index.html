        <h1>Privacy Policy for Uplift</h1>

        <p><em>Last Updated: 21/10/2024</em></p>

        <p>Welcome to Uplift, a social media platform designed to help you share and discover goals, connect with others who have similar ambitions, and foster a supportive community. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how Uplift collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The only personal information we collect from you is your email address and name, which are obtained through Google Sign-In when you create an account. This information is essential for creating your profile and helping you connect with others on the platform.</p>
        <p>We do not collect any other personal information unless you voluntarily share it through the content you post.</p>

        <h2>2. Google Sign-In</h2>
        <p>Uplift uses Google Sign-In as the sole authentication method. When you sign in using your Google account, we only access your email address and name. Uplift does not access other personal data linked to your Google account, such as your contacts, calendar, or location.</p>

        <h2>3. Posting Content</h2>
        <p>On Uplift, users can post about their goals and interact with others in the community. You may choose to share photos or other media when making posts, but this is entirely optional. The photos or content you upload are stored and visible to other users, but we do not use or analyze your posts for any purpose beyond displaying them on the platform.</p>

        <h2>4. Chat Feature</h2>
        <p>Uplift includes a chat feature that allows users to communicate with one another. The content of these chats is private between the users involved. We do not store or monitor chat messages for any purpose other than enabling user communication.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Usage and Sharing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Usage:</strong> Your email and name are used solely to create your profile, identify you to other users, and enable basic functionality within the app, such as connecting with others who have similar goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> Uplift does not share your personal information with third parties. However, the content you post, including photos and text, will be visible to other users of the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate measures to protect your information. Although no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, we strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You have the right to access the personal data we hold about you, which is limited to your name and email.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request to delete your account and any data associated with it by contacting us. Upon deletion, we will remove your account information from our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our app and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
